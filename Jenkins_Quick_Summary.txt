Jenkins 
===============
What is Jenkins ?
Jenkins is a free and open source automation server. It helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery. It is a server-based system that runs in servlet containers such as Apache Tomcat.

Job 
Job is any runnable task that is controlled by Jenkins.
job = project 

The jenkins official documentation indicates that the term Job has been replaced by the term Project.

Jobs in Jenkins:
--> Freestyle Project:
This is the most common type of project.The build step for  this type of project noraly executes a shell (Linux) or batch (Windows) command.

--> Pipelines Project 
This type of project used to be called a workflow.These projects are normally written in Jenkins Domain Specific Language(DSL).

--> Multi-Configuration Project
This is for projects that will be tested on multiple environments, and require different configurations,depending on thos environnments.

--> Folder

--> Multi-branch Pipeleine:

Build: A build is result of single execution of a project.
Source > branch > commit <---> test | feedback ======================> Build
      Pull     Change           Integration      Integration pass
	  

Check SCM
Clean Checkout
Build Code
Perform testing
Check pass fail
Provide Feedback
If pass produce build 

Artifacts & Repositories :

Arifacts are files generated during a build like XML file, JAR file, WAR file, config files
This refers to immutable files that are generated during a buils or a pipeline run.
Artifacts are mainly maitained in a repo and can be on Jekins master or in a SCM (Source Control Manager).

Repo hold items that need to be retrieved.These items can include source code, compiled code artifacts 

Build Tools :
These are the software that actually Performsthe build portion of the pipeleine.

Build tools can include Maven,Ant & shell scripting 

Configuration varies by build tool, but the processes are similar:
1. Start Jenkins & Install required plugins
2. Perform global configuration steps.
3. Create a job/Pipeline that utlizes the build tool.
4. Update the tools configuration files: POM, XML, .config etc.

Source Code manager :
- Software used to track changes in code.
- Changes in code, revisions, are timestamped and include the identity of the person that made the change.
- Jenkins changelogs are used for changes in builds.

Testting :
Unit testing :
--> In this type of test individual compnents classess ,methods, modules ) are tested to ensure that outputs are as expected.

Smoke test :
--> "Plugins something-in and plug-out and see if we get any smoke"
--> Does it load ? , Does all menus work? , Does it crash when the save button is clicked ?

Functional Testing :
Vaerification testing seeks to answer the question : "Did we satisfy the build requirements ?"
--> Does this feature work or Can a user do this ?

Acceptance Testing :
--> This is the handoff test of the software of the client.It is normally done by the client to ensure that the software meets their expectations.
