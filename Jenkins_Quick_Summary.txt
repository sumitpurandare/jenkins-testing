Jenkins 
===============
What is Jenkins ?
Jenkins is a free and open source automation server. It helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery. It is a server-based system that runs in servlet containers such as Apache Tomcat.

Job 
Job is any runnable task that is controlled by Jenkins.
job = project 

The jenkins official documentation indicates that the term Job has been replaced by the term Project.

Jobs in Jenkins:
--> Freestyle Project:
This is the most common type of project.The build step for  this type of project noraly executes a shell (Linux) or batch (Windows) command.

--> Pipelines Project 
This type of project used to be called a workflow.These projects are normally written in Jenkins Domain Specific Language(DSL).

--> Multi-Configuration Project
This is for projects that will be tested on multiple environments, and require different configurations,depending on thos environnments.

--> Folder

--> Multi-branch Pipeleine:

Build: A build is result of single execution of a project.
Source > branch > commit <---> test | feedback ======================> Build
      Pull     Change           Integration      Integration pass
	  

Check SCM
Clean Checkout
Build Code
Perform testing
Check pass fail
Provide Feedback
If pass produce build 

Artifacts & Repositories :

Arifacts are files generated during a build like XML file, JAR file, WAR file, config files
This refers to immutable files that are generated during a buils or a pipeline run.
Artifacts are mainly maitained in a repo and can be on Jekins master or in a SCM (Source Control Manager).

Repo hold items that need to be retrieved.These items can include source code, compiled code artifacts 

Build Tools :
These are the software that actually Performsthe build portion of the pipeleine.

Build tools can include Maven,Ant & shell scripting 

Configuration varies by build tool, but the processes are similar:
1. Start Jenkins & Install required plugins
2. Perform global configuration steps.
3. Create a job/Pipeline that utlizes the build tool.
4. Update the tools configuration files: POM, XML, .config etc.

Source Code manager :
- Software used to track changes in code.
- Changes in code, revisions, are timestamped and include the identity of the person that made the change.
- Jenkins changelogs are used for changes in builds.

Testting :
Unit testing :
--> In this type of test individual compnents classess ,methods, modules ) are tested to ensure that outputs are as expected.

Smoke test :
--> "Plugins something-in and plug-out and see if we get any smoke"
--> Does it load ? , Does all menus work? , Does it crash when the save button is clicked ?

Functional Testing :
Vaerification testing seeks to answer the question : "Did we satisfy the build requirements ?"
--> Does this feature work or Can a user do this ?

Acceptance Testing :
--> This is the handoff test of the software of the client.It is normally done by the client to ensure that the software meets their expectations.

Jenkins API:

Jenkins provides amachine consumable REST style API for programmatically interacting with the Jenkins Server.

"What is REST API?
Representational state transfer is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating Web services. Web services that conform to the REST architectural style, called RESTful Web services, provide interoperability between computer systems on the internet.

Installation on CentOs 7 :
sudo su # this prevents us from having to issue sudo each time.  
yum install -y wget  
wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.repo  
rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.io.key  
yum install jenkins  java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel git -y  
systemctl enable jenkins && systemctl restart jenkins  


for Windows always check if git is installed :

C:\Program Files\Git\bin\sh.exe

===============================================================
http://localhost:8082/job/git_testing/10/console --> use this url or try to restart jenkins service > Computer Management > Services & wait 


Source Code Management plays an important

- Please Install required plugins for Git or any other SCM integration

localhost will no connect to github SOcketXP or other client we need to install

Steps to connect push based events in github and jenkins job should run 

--> Go to github setting > Developers Setting > Personal Access token > Generate new token 
--> Copy newly generated token and paste it to Jenkins > Manage Jenkins > Configure System > Github server and include in jenkins server and ADD
